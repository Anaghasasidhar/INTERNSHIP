Objective

To build a classification model that classifies side effects of a particular drug by Age, Race and Gender

Introduction

Machine learning (ML) is an innovative approach with extensive applications in classification, prediction and forecasting. Machine learning techniques are being used widely in areas such as medicine, engineering, education, manufacturing and production, forecast, traffic management, robotics etc. Machine learning has already shown its potential in pharma and medicine - finding ways to effectively collect and use lots of different types of data for better analysis, prevention, and treatment.

Drugs, an important way to treat various diseases, inevitably produce side effects bringing great risks to human bodies and pharmaceutical companies. How to predict the side effects of drugs is a perennial challenge in drug research.

For this project, a dataset of WebMD sourced from Kaggle has been used. As this dataset lacked ‘Name’ and ‘Race’ features, the two were randomly generated using Faker Python Module and then concatenated with it. The master dataset featured 14 columns and 362806 rows.

Conclusion



From different modelling, the best classification model was obtained by Gradient Boosting. On performance evaluation, maximum accuracy of 67.71% has been achieved.

By race, Whites topped in the usage of this drug with a higher female ratio. Domination of female users were consistent across age groups. Also, people in the age groups 35 to 44, 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 accounted for maximum usage of cymbalta. Most users found cymbalta as highly effective, especially females. Side effects of the drug proved race neutral. Genderwise, side effects proved extreme in females.
